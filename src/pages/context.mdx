  ## Dependencies of an NFT
  I'm in crypto since Early 2015, Prototyped and collaborated with many early-stage blockchain and cryptocurrencies. My feed includes Market TA, Dev and feature rollouts, market insights, and thoughts.
-
  ## Interlinking NFTs
  Experimenting through various paths and methods, I have been living a techno Spiritual life for 7 years. Constantly learning and
  experiencing reality without getting attached.
-
  ## Standalone Framework
  My love for Entheogens is immaculate, I love experimenting with altered states of consciousness. I'm passionate about the extraction of natural psychedelics and their experiences. 
-
  ## Embeddedness of Digital Assets
  I believe every human is equally made with the divine spirit, everyone has the potential to become the master. I explore the de-personification and Ego diffusing aspects of life and its benefits.

We create an Oracle for bridging and linking all existing digital assets. We map all NFTs, ENS, and other virtual assets in a standalone platform. We create, curate, and collect the Context for The Oracle of Binary Bodi. The Oracle of Binary Bodi is the genesis edition by Metaverse Press Syndicate. Only Syndicate Members can contribute or submit or License their assets. Membership will be granted by purchasing Syndicate Pass.
