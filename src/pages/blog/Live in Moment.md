You are exactly where you are supposed to be. Even when times are tough, even when you have no idea why you are doing what you are doing, even when you have the urge to compare yourself to others, you are always exactly where you need to be in order to become the best version of yourself, and others are exactly where they are supposed to be in order to become the best version of themselves. Your journey might look different than those around you, but that’s because it is uniquely yours


Life is all about learning lessons. We are given challenges in order to help us grow. You might be worried about what your next move is or where you are heading in the future, but I urge you to focus on where you are in the present moment. The past that you’ve experienced is what got you to where you are today, and whether or not that is where you want to be, know that the universe is always working in your favor. Trust in your own strength and in the inner guidance that you have cultivated on your journey. There is something greater than yourself that guided you to be where you are, and there is a reason for it. The reason may not always be pretty — perhaps it is to wake and shake you up to get you to stop blindly following what others are telling you to do and to do what you know is best for yourself. But even that is a reason.


Don’t be afraid to let go of what no longer serves you in order to stay present and in alignment with your truth. Every time you let go of what no longer serves you, you make room for something bigger and better to come your way. When you stay present, you allow the universe to act on your behalf to put you on the path that will light your soul on fire. You are co-creating with the universe. Sometimes the path that you have chosen for yourself is not working out because it is not meant for you. The universe has something much greater for you in store, and it is exactly what you want. It might be something that is beyond your own ability to comprehend, understand, or even be aware is possible at this time.


We have to stop telling ourselves that we are failing. We have to stop telling ourselves that we won’t make it because we haven’t yet. We have to stop telling ourselves that we are losing. Because there’s nothing to lose. We are only gaining—knowledge, wisdom, experience, and lessons. Everything we go through teaches us how to survive. Every obstacle helps us learn who we are. Every painful moment breaks us but builds us. And little by little, we are making it through.

So stop. Stop worrying. Stop wondering. Stop letting yourself feel defeated and broken. You are none of those things. You are a person who is growing, changing, learning, becoming, and succeeding. And where you are right now? That’s exactly where you’re supposed to be. Trust at the moment, and more importantly, trust yourself. You are incredible and strong
