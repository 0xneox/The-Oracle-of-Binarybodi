Shiva symbolizes consciousness, the masculine principle. The paternal love of God gives us consciousness, clarity, and knowledge. Shiva is called Purusha.


Shakti symbolizes the feminine principle, the activating power, and energy. The motherly love of God surrounds us with warmth, caring, and protection. Shakti is the provider, abundance. In the human as well as in the animal kingdom the mother offers nourishment, warmth, and security.


Lord Shiva is usually seen with a trident, which represents the trinity of Īshwara, Purusha, and Prakriti.

Īshwara is the omnipresent, eternal, formless divine principle;

Purusha is the Ātmā and Prakriti is the manifestation, of nature.


Shiva / Purusha is pure consciousness – the unchanging, unlimited, and unswayable observer. Purusha has no desires whatsoever; these are inherent only in Prakriti. Purusha is the empty, clear screen onto which Prakriti projects her colorful film.

Shakti / Prakriti is energy, power, movement, change, and nature. It is the maternal principle – the provider, abundance. In the human as well as in the animal kingdom the mother offers nourishment, warmth, and security.

Shiva and Shakti are manifestations of the all-in-one divine consciousness - different sides of the same coin. In Art of living, we can see a big portrait of Shiva-Shakti, the left side depicting the Divine Mother, Pārvatī, the feminine energy, and the right side represents Shiva, the masculine consciousness.


Only when Shiva and Shakti combine can action, movement and creation arise. Until energy is impregnated with consciousness it is ignorant, disordered, aimless, and blind.
Ironically, Energy alone can produce nothing; consciousness bestows upon it content, form, and direction.

Consciousness without energy is dormant power, sleeping energy, and on its own is unable to be the cause of anything.

Just as Prakriti without Purusha is unable to act, and vice versa, Purusha without Prakriti is also incapable of creating anything. Through the splitting of the primordial principle at the advent of creation the duality within our lives came into being, together with a strong force that is constantly striving to re-unite with the other part.


The meaning of Shiva and Shakti is occasionally misunderstood when Shiva and Shakti are looked upon as “man” and “woman” and their union is regarded as a sexual relationship. Sexuality is something completely natural, and misunderstanding arises only when sexuality and spirituality are mixed.

Sexuality is the union of man and woman,
Spirituality is the union of the human and the divine consciousness.
Shiva and Shakti exist within each of us as masculine and feminine principles. This has an effect on the physical level – it is the cause of sexual attraction. Within men, there exists a tendency toward the feminine qualities, and within women a tendency toward the masculine. Through this, the masculine consciousness is attracted by the feminine and vice versa. If both are in balance there is no sexual attraction. But if a tendency for the masculine predominates in men or the feminine in women, this results in an LGBTQ.

Shiva resides in the Sahasrāra Chakra and Shakti in the Mūlādhāra Chakra. When Prakriti and Purusha unite in the Sahasrāra Chakra, knowledge, knower, and the object of knowledge become one.


For as long as consciousness is connected to the physical body it is unable to remain constantly in the Sahasrāra Chakra and so returns to the residence of the Ātmā in the Heart Chakra. A realized person always thinks, feels, and acts from the heart. Embedded in eternal love and eternal happiness, that person is always conscious of the immortal Ātmā, the ocean of bliss, and their consciousness is forever connected to the divine consciousness.

I wish all blessings of the Divine Mother & Divine Father who is omnipresent, can be in any form and can feel the presence everywhere. Maybe it's your sister or brother or a random friend you meet on the trek, or your father or mother or teacher or even pets and mountains and river and plants and all and all.
