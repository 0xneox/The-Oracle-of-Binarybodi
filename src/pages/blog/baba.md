Words cannot merely express my feeling when writing about my Maharaji, Ever since I heard about him there is a never ending
desire to meet him IRL. I am unnsure whether this is a Guru- disciple relation or something beyond that, only he knows. 
I got to know about Maharaji through Krishna Das and Ram Dass; Somewhere in the deep heart, I know him very well.
Getting addicted to bhajans of KD makes my journey towards Maharaji Simpler. 

As of today, I have visted Kainchi Dam thrice and was able to spend some quality time in the Ashram. Unlike every other Ashrams I have ever been to, Kainchi Dam stands out in it's own way. Mostly due to the celestial energy of Babaji.
