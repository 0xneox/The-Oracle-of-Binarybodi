5meo = 5-methoxy-N N-dimethyltryptamine = C12H16N2O
DMT= N N-Dimethyltryptamine = C12H16N2

Both of em fall under the tryptamine class, however, 5meo is a derivative of DMT itself whereas DMT is Substituted tryptamine. These duos are present everywhere; be it in plants, animals, or fungi, and also present in the cerebrospinal fluid of humans.

Even though both of them exhibit structural and chemical similarities, the psychotropic effects produced in humans are different. I can take DMT all day w/o worrying about the experience since it produces a vivid and profound feeling. Even though we get a peak inter-dimensional visions, with improved awareness and Machine/DMT Elves encounters, One can experience and enjoy the profound natural state of life.

Meanwhile, 5meo cuts all this mess and straightaway pushes one to the state of Nirvana/Samadi, which literally means Void / Nothingness. I would never call bufo a bad trip since there doesn't exist good/bad in this realm. The experience exhibited by 5meo is the ultimate reality, there is nothing beyond. You are left with a single choice, Surrender

Also, 5meo is not recreational / party stuff neither it is recommended for psychedelic trips.IMO it works well for self-inquiry or realization, one should accept Severe ego diffusion while on 5meo which I honestly believe the majority can't bear ( that is called a bad trip).

Anyway just realize the fact, that the peak 5meo experience is pretty much similar to the supreme state or reality.

Buddha called it Shunyata,
Shiva called it Brahman,
Dionysus called it Luminous darkness

Well, I am calling it Nirvana !!

Stay safe and Happy tripping.
