Numbers are the core contributing factor for a stable manifested universe, Everything has precise values. The significance
of numbers and mathematics is so high it prompts us to learn Maths from Pre-school to master. 
When you are designing any apps or games or anything which is in digital format is ultimately made up of two signals [0,1]
Binary is the language of machines, similarly, numbers are the language of humans. 
As Ramanujan said...

Generation Z has so many fancy universal numbers representing various harmonize frequencies like 111, 888, 777 etc. 
AFAIK it depends upon person-person; From my experience numbers were always helpful in filtering out my thoughts, increasing my intuition etc. I have been practicing this technique for almost 4 years+ and still works like a charm. 

I choose my lucky number viz a combination of the zodiac and planetary orientation, I consider 1,5,7 as the lucky number for myself.
and 9 as a bad omen. 1 represents the universe, 5 represents me, 7 represents my soul/spirit. I will filter out thoughts and decisions made upon summing the time. For eg If I encounter a situation that requires a choice to be made, I look upon the time '12:34' and add all digits --> 1; which means I am good to go with that idea/thought/suggestion/choice. 

I believe ultimately it depends upon my Mind, I don't think it can be applied to everyone's life. However, if you start believing, it will automatically happen. I am practicing this method for the last 4 years, and every time it works as intended.
