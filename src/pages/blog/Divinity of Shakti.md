Observe. my brethren, what happens to those whose eyes remain closed to the light, and who are deprived of the assistance of the Almighty!

For us, a female prophet has arisen.
Her laws we follow; for the rest of mankind.
The prophets that appeared were always men.

“The light of the body is the eye: if therefore thin eye is single, thy whole body shall be full of light.”

When a meritorious man finds himself near to women, his member grows, gets strong, vigorous, and hard; he is not quick to discharge, and after the trembling caused by the emission of the sperm, he is soon stiff again.


Such a man is liked and appreciated by women; this is because the woman loves the man only for the sake of coition. His members should, therefore, be of ample dimensions and length. Such a man ought to be broad in the chest, and heavy in the crupper; he should know how to regulate his emission, and be ready as to erection; his member should reach the end of the canal of the female, and completely fill the same in all its parts. Such a one will be well beloved by women.

I have seen women trying to find in young men
The durable qualities which grace the man of full power,
The beauty, the enjoyment, the reserve, the strength,
The full-formed member providing a lengthened coition,
A heavy cropper, a slowly coming emission,
A lightsome chest, as it was floating upon them;
The sperm ejaculation slow to arrive, so as
To furnish forth a long drawn-out enjoyment.
His member soon to be prone again for erection,
To ply the plane again and again and again on their vulvas,
Such is the man whose cult gives pleasure to women,
And who will ever stand high in their esteem?


If a man is not strong and rich he will obtain nothing from women.

The virile member, to please women, must have at most a length of the breadth of twelve fingers, or three handbreadths, and at least six fingers, or a hand and a half breadth.

There are men with members of twelve fingers or three hand-breadths; others of ten fingers, or two and a half hands. And others measure eight fingers or two hands. A man whose member is of fewer dimensions cannot please women.

The use of perfumes, by men as well as by women, excites the act of copulation. The woman, inhaling the perfumes employed by the man, becomes intoxicated; and the use of scents has often proved a strong help to the man, and assisted him in getting possession of a woman.

In order that a woman may be relished by men:

She must have a perfect waist and must be plump and lusty;
Her hair will be black her forehead wide;
She will have eyebrows of Ethiopian blackness, and large black eyes, with the whites in the limpid;
With a cheek of perfect oval, she will have an elegant nose and a graceful mouth;
Her breath will be of pleasant odor, her throat long, her neck strong, her bust and her belly large;
Her breasts must be full and firm, her belly in good proportion, and her navel well-developed and marked;
The lower part of the belly is to be large, the vulva projecting and fleshy, from the point where the hairs grow to the buttocks;
The conduit must be narrow and not moist, soft to the touch, and emit a strong heat and no bad smell;
She must have the thighs and buttocks hard, the hips large and full, a waist of fine shape, hands and feet of striking elegance, plump arms, and well-developed shoulders;
If one looks at a woman with those qualities in front, one is fascinated; if from behind, one dies with pleasure.
Looked at a sitting, she is a rounded dome; lying, a soft-bed;
When she is walking, her natural parts appear as set off under her clothing. She speaks and laughs rarely, and never without a reason. She never leaves the house, even to see neighbors of her acquaintance. She has no women friends, gives her confidence to nobody, and her husband is her sole reliance. She takes nothing from anyone, except her husband and her parents. If she sees relatives, she does not meddle with their affairs. She is not treacherous and has no faults to hide, nor bad reasons to proffer. She does not try to entice people. If her husband shows his intention of performing the conjugal rite, she is agreeable to his desires and occasionally even provokes them. She assists him always in his affairs, and is sparing in complaints and tears; she does not laugh or rejoice when she sees her husband moody or sorrowful, but shares his troubles, and wheedles him into good humor, till he is quite content again. She does not surrender herself to anybody but her husband, even if abstinence would kill her. She hides her secret parts, and does not allow them to be seen; she is always elegantly attired, of the utmost personal propriety, and takes care not to let her husband see what might be repugnant to him.


This story presents but a small part of the tricks and stratagems used by women against their husbands.

The moral of the tale is, that a man who falls in love with a woman imperils himself, and exposes himself to the greatest troubles.

that a man who is misshapen, of coarse appearance, and whose membership is short, thin, and flabby, is contemptible in the eyes of women.

When such a man has a bout with a woman, he does not do his business with vigor and in a manner to give her enjoyment. He lays himself down upon her without previous toying, he does not kiss her, nor twine himself around her; he does not bite her, nor suck her lips, nor tickle her.

He gets up on her before she has begun to long for pleasure, and then he introduces with infinite trouble a member soft and nerveless. Scarcely has he commenced when he is already done for; he makes one or two movements and then sinks upon the woman's breast to spend his sperm, and that is the most he can do. This done he withdraws his affair, and makes all haste to get down again from her.

Such a man--as was said by a writer--is quick in ejaculation and slow as to erection; after the trembling, which follows the ejaculation of the seed, his chest is heavy and his sides ache.

Qualities like these are not recommended for women. Despicable also is the man who is false in his words; who does not fulfill the promise he has made; who never speaks without telling lies, and who conceals from his wife all his doings, except the adulterous exploits which he commits.

Women cannot esteem such men, as they cannot procure them any enjoyment.
