God or Brahman is referred to as Sat-Chit-Ananda or Sachchidananda (सच्चिदानन- द). It means "Being, Consciousness, Bliss". It is a description of the subjective experience of Brahman. This sublimely blissful experience of the boundless, pure consciousness is a glimpse of ultimate reality.

The three Sanskrit words involved are:

SAT – सत् - "Truth", "Absolute Being", "a palpable force of virtue and truth". Sat describes an essence that is pure and timeless, that never changes.
CHIT - चित्  -  "consciousness", "true consciousness", "to be consciousness of", "to understand", "to comprehend"
ANANDA - आनन्द -  "bliss", "true bliss", "happiness", "joy", "delight", "pleasure"
"Sat-Chit-Ananda" or "Sachchidananda" is the Sanskrit compound form of the word, which can be translated as "Eternal Consciousness Bliss" or "Absolute Consciousness Bliss" or "Consisting of existence and thought and joy". SAT meaning Truth, Existence or Pure Being, Chit means Consciousness and Ananda means Bliss.

 

For Vaishnava (devotee of Lord Vishnu), Sachchidananda is related to Vaikunta, abode of Lord Vishnu.

Brahma Samhita is composed of verses of prayer spoken by Brahma glorifying the supreme Lord Krishna at the beginning of creation.  Verse 5.1 of the Brahma Samhita states:

Krishna, who is known as Govind, is the Supreme Godhead. He has an eternal blissful spiritual body. He is the origin of all. He has no other origin and He is the prime cause of all causes. In other words Lord Krishna is Sat-Chit-Ananda.

 

According to J. M. Macfie, , one of the most beautiful expressions of Tulsidas's faith in God and in Ram as the incarnation of God can be found in the following statement:

The Adorable (Bhagavan) is one, passionless, formless, nameless, unborn, existence, thought, joy (Sachchidananda), the supreme abode.

In Sri Aurobindo's evolutionary vision of the soul and the Universe, of which Sachchidananda is the principal term, even though the soul is incarnate in Maya and subject to space, matter and time, it maintains an ongoing and eternal oneness with Sachchidananda or divinity. This incarnating aspect or dimension of the human being, the spirit-soul, or the Psychic Being’ is the staple essence that reincarnates from life to life. This essence is of the energetic quality of Sachchidananda.

According to the Vedas, Sachchidananda, or Brahman, is in its true nature pure spirit; and Maya, which is inherent in it, functions only on the relative plane at the time of creation, preservation and destruction; neither is the creation ultimately real, nor are created beings, for true knowledge reveals only an undifferentiated consciousness.

 

According to Tantra, on the other hand, Sachchidananda is called Siva-Shakti, the hyphenated word suggesting that Siva or the Absolute, and Shakti, or its creative power, are eternally conjoined like a word and its meaning; the one cannot be thought of without the other. A conception of pure consciousness or being which denies Shakti, or the power to become, is, according to Tantra, only half of the truth. Sachchidananda is essentially endowed with the power of self-evolution and self-involution. Therefore perfect experience is the experience of the whole- that is to say, of consciousness as being and consciousness as power to become.

The aim of waking the Kundalini is not the acquisition of greater power for the purpose of performing miraculous feats or the enjoyment of material pleasures; it is the realisation of Sachchidananda. In Advaita Vedanta, Sachchidananda is considered a description of the Absolute (Brahman). Whereas in Saiva Siddhanta it is understood as divine form - pure, amorphous matter or energy - not as an equivalent of the Absolute, formless, "atattva," Parasiva.

Sachchidananda can be a single word describing being awake. Let us understand it individually: 

SAT is Truth, Existence or Pure Being. SAT is what always remains regardless of time or situation. When we awaken, we constantly recognize Pure Being. We are consciously aware of Pure Being as our true nature, the core and foundation of all life. 


CHIT or Consciousness is the first manifestation of our true nature. It is streaming from all of creation. When consciousness becomes conscious of itself, it is like looking in the mirror at your own eyes or looking into the eyes of another. There is a simple and deep recognition of the absolute as yourself and in everything else. 


Amazingly, consciousness is often not aware of itself. It is usually the mind's distractions which keep consciousness from being "self-aware." However, when the mind is allowed to be still, consciousness can simply gaze upon it, and Sat Chit Ananda is realized. 


Pure being and consciousness are always present although they may not be recognized. And it is mostly the mind or ego which distracts us from the direct experience of this divine presence. 


When the mind unwinds and becomes calmer, Bliss, Love and Happiness naturally arise. 

They are not evoked. They are natural like light shining from the sun. The awakened one doesn't need to "think good thoughts" to feel good. Feeling good is our natural state when the mind is calm and open. 


ANANDA is the eternal happiness, the Bliss.  Letting go of the mind for a moment as we watch a sunset or a sunrise, Bliss arises naturally. So Ananda is as natural and inherent as Pure Being and Consciousness. Awakened ones simply have direct experience and knowledge of their absolute, untouched and eternal existence as Sat-Chit-Ananda, Pure Being-Consciousness-Bliss.

In Yoga, Sachchidananda is said to happen for short or longer moments associated with moments of spiritual insights, glimpses into the unknown, revelations, realization, Sabija Samadhi, transcendental experiences, moments of inspiration, and the raising of the Kundalini. Thus Sachchidananda shines through as a result of an authentic practice into every corner of our life -- the "object" (existing only when one is not abiding in the eternal now) is to return to this reality when we find ourselves separate -- to make this realization more continuously, accessible, and available -- in perpetual continuity (Nirbija samadhi) -- to merge its eternal aspect into the weave of all our relations.

 

Om Sivoham Om Sivoham Om Sivoham Soham

Sat-Chit-Ananda Swaroopoham

I am Shiv, I am Brahman, I am the Sat-Chit-Ananda form of the Supreme.

Sat-Chit-Ananda is our true nature. We don’t realize it as we are under the effect of Maya. When the veil of Maya is removed, we realize ourselves that we are actually eternal. conscious and blissful as the Supreme Himself. 

 

OM Tat Sat - We are that Truth.
