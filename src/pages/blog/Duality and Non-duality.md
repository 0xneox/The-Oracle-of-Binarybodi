We live in a world of apparent duality. There is “I” and there are other people, objects, ideas, and emotions. Time, space, causality, and language all depend upon and relate to this world. Whilst every “thing” else changes, however, “I” who witnesses and knows all of these experiences remain the same.


This separation is grounded in our use of language. At the earliest age, we are taught to differentiate and “name” the things around us – “me”, the subject, and “something else”, the object. But these names are actually “attributes” and not things in themselves. We refer to a “golden ring” with “ring” as a separate noun but a ring is actually only a transient form of gold – we should really call it “ring gold.” The form is the “attribute” of the object and should be expressed as an adjective and not a noun.

But gold is only a particular and temporary configuration of protons, neutrons, and electrons so it too is an adjective or attribute. Similarly, protons, etc. are themselves made up of still smaller particles, called quarks. Ultimately, everything is only the name and form of that fundamental reality which is changeless – the only noun that is not an attribute of something else.


There is a famous quotation in the Chandogya Upanishad - Sarvam Khalvidam Brahma - all this (universe) is verily Brahman. By following back all of the relative appearances in the world, we eventually return to that from which it is all manifest – the non-dual reality.
