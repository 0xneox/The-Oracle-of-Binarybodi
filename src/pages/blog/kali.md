The name Kali comes from the word “Kala,” or time. She is the power of time that devours all. She has a power that destroys and should be depicted in awe-inspiring terror. Kali is found in the cremation ground amid dead bodies. She is standing in a challenging posture on the prostrate body of her husband Shiva. Kali cannot exist without him, and Shiva can’t reveal himself without her. She is the manifestation of Shiva’s power and energy. While Shiva’s complexion is pure white, Kali is the color of the darkest night-a deep bluish-black. As the limitless Void, Kali has swallowed up everything without a trace. Hence, she is black.

Kali’s luxuriant hair is disheveled and, thereby, symbolizes Kali’s boundless freedom. Another interpretation says that each hair is a jiva (individual soul), and all souls have their roots in Kali. Kali has three eyes; the third one stands for wisdom. Kali’s tongue is protruding, a gesture of coyness because she unwittingly stepped on the body of her husband Shiva. A more philosophical interpretation of Kali’s tongue is that it symbolizes Rajas (the color red, activity) and that it is held by her teeth, symbolizing sattva (the color white, spirituality).

Kali has four arms. The posture of her right arm promises fearlessness and boons while her left arms hold a bloody sword and a freshly severed human head. Looking at Kali’s right, we see good, and looking at her left, we see bad. Kali is portrayed as naked except for a girdle of human arms cut off at the elbow and a garland of fifty skulls. The arms represent the capacity for work, and Kali wears all work (action), potential work, and the results thereof around her waist. The fifty skulls represent the fifty letters of the Hindu alphabet, the manifest state of sound from which all creation evolved.

Kali’s nudity has a similar meaning. In many instances, she is described as garbed in space or sky clad. In her absolute, primordial nakedness she is free from all covering of illusion. She is Nature (Prakriti in Sanskrit), stripped of ‘clothes’. It symbolizes that she is completely beyond name and form, completely beyond the effects of Maya (illusion). Her nudity is said to represent totally illumined consciousness, unaffected by Maya. Kali is the bright fire of truth, which cannot be hidden by the clothes of ignorance. Such truth simply burns them away.

Despite Kali’s origins in battle, she evolved into a full-fledged symbol of Mother Nature in her creative, nurturing, and devouring aspects. Some groups of people, unfamiliar with the precepts of Hinduism, see Kali as a satanic demon probably because of tales of her being worshipped by dacoits and other such people indulging evil acts.

Kali is the first and foremost among Mahavidya's. According to yogini tantra, Devi Parvati assumed this form to slay a demon called Ghorasura. Seeing this form, Lord shiva requested kali to enlighten him by placing a foot on his chest. She has an insatiable thirst for blood. As mistress of blood, she presides over the mysteries of both life and death. Kali intends her bloody deeds for the protection of the good. She may get carried away by her gruesome acts but she is not evil. Kali’s destructive energies on the highest level are seen as a vehicle of salvation and ultimate transformation.

Dakshina Kali is the Saumya Roopam (sublime form) of Devi Kali.

In the simplest terms, Devi Kali is the embodiment of time, as her name suggests.

In Shakta traditions (of people who worship the Devi as the Brahman), Kali is also a creative deity, the mother Goddess, the primordial energy of the universe, the Devi that embodies the Guna of Tamas (Quality of inertia), a destroyer of demons (physical and spiritual), the first among the Mahavidyas (great-knowledge) and a protective deity.

Like all deities, Kali has various forms like Mahakali, Bhadrakali, Dakshina Kali, Shmashana Kali etc. Each of her forms is representative of a certain aspect.

Dakshina Kali
Dakshina Kali is the most popular form of Kali worshipped in Shakta households. She is identified with her right leg over Shiva and a smiling countenance. In this form, she is usually shown with four, eight, or ten arms and three eyes. Her skin is bluish and she has a crescent moon on her brow.

This Roopam is Saumya and is considered a passive and motherly form of Kali, ideal for propitiation and asking of boons.

I am not sure what the Vedic literature says about her since the Vedas speak of a Devi but not specifically of Kali as a Goddess. The Kalika Purana is dedicated to Kali, and other puranas like Linga Purana and Devi Purana also deal with her.

The Devi Mahatmya/Durga Saptashati, which is the most important book for Shakta worship, is also called SriSriChandi in the honor of Kali.

Kali was first manifested when the Goddess Parvati knitted her brows in fury when the demon, Daruka, threatened the Gods. It was then that the three-eyed Kali first sprang forth from Parvati, fully armed, and immediately putting an end to Daruka. It is for this reason that Kali is considered an aspect of Parvati.

Kali is the central deity of Time. She created the world and destroys it. She is beyond time and space. After the destruction of the Universe, at the end of the great cycle, she collects the seeds of the next creation. She destroys the finite to reveal the Infinite. This Black Goddess is death, but to the wise she is also the death of death. This can only be revealed through the worship of Kali, and meditation on her mysteries.

As Kundalini the Female Serpent, she resembles the archaic Egyptian serpent-mother said to have created the world. It was said of Kundalini that at the beginning of the universe, she starts to uncoil in “a spiral line movement, which is the movement of creation.” This spiral line was vitally important in late Paleolithic and Neolithic religious symbolism, representing death and rebirth as movement into the disappearing point of formlessness, and out of it again, to a new world of form. Spirals, therefore, appeared on tombs, as one of the world’s first mystical symbols.

To her worshippers in both Hinduism and Tantra, she represents a multi-faceted Great Goddess responsible for all of life from conception to death. Her worship, therefore, consists of fertility festivals as well as sacrifices (animal and human); and her initiations expand one’s consciousness by any means, including fear, ritual sexuality, and intoxication with a variety of drugs.

Kali is also associated with intense sexuality. Myths tell of the Yoni (vagina) of Kali (when she existed as Sati – wife of Lord Shiva) falling down to the Earth on the sacred hill near Gauhati in Assam (India), the same place where the Temple of Kamakhya is now located.

In terms of devotion and worship, this denotes the dissolving of attachments, anger, lust, and other binding emotions, feelings, and ideas. The heart of the devotee is where this burning takes place, and it is in the heart that Kali dwells. The devotee makes her image in his heart and under her influence burns away all limitations and ignorance in the cremation fires. This inner cremation fire in the heart is the Gyan Agni (fire of knowledge), which Kali bestows.

Kali is the universal mother. It is believed that she goes into the darkness with us, and for us, to swallow our sins, worries, and concerns. She can show us how to radically transform our lives by embracing our own darkness, rather than fearing and fleeing from that which haunts us. She can spiritually hack away at the handcuffs that keep us shackled to the hungry ghosts of the past. There comes a point in the process when you must surrender fully to her healing powers, and let her bring you back cleansed, transformed, and whole.

When there were neither the creation, nor the sun, the moon, the planets, and the earth, when the darkness was enveloped in darkness, then the Mother, the Formless One, Maha Kali, the Power, was one with the Maha Kala, the Absolute. As Mahakali, she is the timeless, immortal, formless power indistinguishable from the transcendent one or Absolute Power.

Kali is “the divine Shakti representing both the creative and destructive aspects of nature”, and as such, she is a goddess who both gives life and brings death. Clothed only with the veil of space, her blue-black nakedness symbolizes the eternal night of non-existence, a night that is free of any illusion and distinction. Kali as such is the pure and primary reality, the enfolded order, formless void yet full of potential.

Kali represents the entire physical plane. She is the drama, tragedy, humor, and sorrow of life. She is the brother, father, sister, mother, lover, and friend. She is the fiend, monster, beast, and brute. She is the sun and the ocean. She is the grass and the dew. She is our sense of accomplishment and our sense of doing worthwhile things. Our thrill of discovery is a pendant on her bracelet. Our gratification is a spot of color on her cheek. Our sense of importance is the bell on her ankle. The full and seductive, terrible and wonderful earth mother always has something to offer

The Kama is the enjoyment of appropriate objects by the five senses of hearing, feeling, seeing, tasting, and smelling, assisted by the mind together with the soul. The ingredient in this is a peculiar contact between the organ of sense and its object, and the consciousness of pleasure which arises from that contact is called the Kama

An ideal woman is represented as a hybrid figure of Kali, who has the qualities of Sita, Laksmi, and Saraswati

"Another consequence of this belief regarding promiscuity of women is that it legitimizes the sexual harassment of these women. In some villages of Kerala, where this belief regarding Kali is more prominent, men justify their eve-teasing by saying that since women have uncontrollable sexual desires, they themselves want to be teased and touched. Hence, the act of molestation became a right and a duty of men to ‘satisfy’ the needs of women."

The four Purusharthas from the lowest to the highest are:

kama – pleasure or desire, artha – wealth, dharma – righteousness or morality and moksha – liberation from the cycle of rebirth, with dharma being placed first in the order and Moksha at the last signifying the fact that Dharma is the common element, a general frame-work, a medium through which one must attain kama, artha and moksha.

Genesis
In the beginning, the Lord of beings created men and women and, in the form of commandments in one hundred thousand chapters, laid down rules for regulating their existence with regard to dharma, artha, and kama. Further, it says, “Man, the period of whose life is one hundred years, should practise dharma, artha and kama at different times and in such a manner that they may harmonise together and not clash in any way.

He should acquire learning in his childhood, in his youth and middle age he should attend artha and kama, and in his old age he should perform (Nivritti) dharma, and thus seek to gain moksha, i.e. release from further transmigration.

It is this harmony of dharma, kama, artha and moksha that is also the foundation of less traversed but more maligned path- the path of the tantras. The tantras does not reject anything as taboo, but it seeks to accept the human desires and passions including the bestial tendencies for what they are and then use them to rise above them. This it does in a variety of ways that are suitable for people with different temperaments and competencies.

Hence, a person who wants to overcome his sexual desires can do so by practicing the duties of householder with restraint of his senses. Through this practice of restraining senses called as “Indriya Nigraha”, he would slowly become detached and dispassionate. Or such a person may instead use sex as a tool, as a medium of worship, which would result in satiation of his sexual desires and at the same time making way for spiritual upliftment.

Sex is worship, a sacrifice. It is an act by which the partners involved surrender their ego in order to gain pleasure, progeny and, eventually, even enlightenment.

Brhad-Âranyaka Upanisad says “Her lap is a sacrificial altar; her hair the sacrificial grass; her skin the soma-press. The two labia of the vulva are the fire in the middle. Verily, indeed, as great as is the world of him who sacrifices with the Vâjapeya [“Strength-libation”, libation is an act of pouring a liquid as a sacrifice (as to a deity)] sacrifice, so great is the world of him who practices sexual intercourse”

In Vijnana Bhairava Tantra, during a conversation between Shiva and Shakti, Devi asks: “O Shiva, what is your reality?/ What is this wonder-filled universe?/ What constitutes seed?/ Who center’s the universal wheel?/ What is this life beyond the form pervading forms?/ How may we enter it fully,/ above space and time,/ names and descriptions?/ Let my doubts be cleared!”

Shiva explains her 112 methods of meditation to attain enlightenment which includes few sexual meditations. He says:

“At the start of sexual union/ Keep attentive on the fire in the beginning,/ And so continuing,/ Avoid the embers in the end./ When in such embrace your senses are shaken as leaves,/ Enter this shaking./ Even remembering union,/ Without the embrace.”

There are certain tantric sadhanas called as “Lata Sadhanas”, wherein partners identify themselves with Bhairava-Bhairavi and use sexual union to attain Samadhi. Samadhi is a state where the ego vanishes. In a sexual act, too, when the two partners unite together, when their passions reach their peak, for very brief moments, they both will experience a state of non-ego. If this state can be harnessed and lengthened, then it can lead one to “Samadhi”.

Kularnava tantra
Kularnava Tantra clearly says- “Beguiled by false knowledge as propagated, certain persons, deprived of the guru-shishya tradition, imagine the nature of the Kuladharma according to their own intellect. If merely by drinking wine, men were to attain fulfillment, all addicted to liquor would reach perfection. If mere partaking of flesh were to lead to the high state, all the carnivores in the world would become eligible for immense merit. If liberation were to be ensured by sexual intercourse with a Shakti, all creatures would become liberated by female companionship “ Hence, every sexual encounter does not lead to Samadhi. Sexual recklessness does not lead to Spiritual progress. But, when a Sexual act is treated as worship, as a meditation and the act is used to stabilize the mind and withdraw the senses, one attains dynamic equilibrium. This dynamic stillness when harnessed will in turn lead to Samadhi. A normal sexual encounter ends when the partners climax and the male ejaculates. But, in a Lata-Sadhana, there is no ejaculation. When the partners reach the state of highest passion, they instead enter into a state of Samadhi. This is in fact very difficult to achieve for most people. Only a few have the competency to practice them. It is the ignorance of such nuances that has led to misunderstanding of tantras.

[P.S] “However Samadhi here doesn't exhibit a permanent state of turiya, rather it occurs instantly without any internal or external efforts. But that state can never be considered as the supreme reality or ultimate sammadi.

Samadhi is a state of consciousness, similar to our everyday consciousness the difference is we can experience the transcendental shift of energy instantly without relying on any materia*

It can neither be explained nor can it be learned . There doesn't exist any doctrine that simulates the experience of Samadi, and can never be !! There are many kinds of Samadhi;

Savikalpa / Nirvikalpa
In Savikalpa we unit mind into the Cosmic Mind { again MAYA} in Nirvikalpa it is towards Supreme Consciousness. In the Cosmic Cycle, the step-by-step introversion and subtilization of consciousness from the state of solid matter to Nucleus Consciousness

Manusmriti
The Manusmriti recognizes eight kinds of marriages of which “gandharva marriage” is one. It is a voluntary union of a maiden and her lover, which arises from desire and sexual intercourse for its purpose/.

The support of scriptures for Love marriages or by extension for pre-marital sex between lovers who eventually marry should not be considered as a support for recent practices of sexual recklessness like one-night stands that has no element of love. The practices of dating multiple people for sex, or visiting prostitutes or one night stands are indeed considered as sexual recklessness and hence are against the basic tenet of Dharma- the Indriya Nigraha. Such actions are considered as transgressions of Dharma. The same is the case with extra-marital affairs. It is considered as a sin, an adharma because it involves cheating.

A female, therefore, should learn the Kama Shastra, or at least a part of it, by studying its practice from some confidential friend. She should study alone in private the sixty-four practices that form a part of the Kama Shastra. Her teacher should be one of the following persons: the daughter of a nurse brought up with her and already married, 2 or a female friend who can be trusted in everything, or the sister of her mother (i.e. her aunt), or an old female servant, or a female beggar who may have formerly lived in the family, or her own sister who can always be trusted.

Dharma is acquisition of religious merit.
Artha is acquisition of wealth and property, etc.
Kama is love, pleasure and sensual gratification.
These three words are retained throughout in their original, as technical terms. They may also be defined as virtue, wealth and pleasure, the three things repeatedly spoken of in the Laws of Manu.

Sage Yajnavalkya, the greatest of Upanishadic philosophers, taught the great doctrine of “neti-neti”, the view that truth can be found only through the negation of all thoughts about it

The doctrine of “Neti, Neti” in this Upanishad suggests it is possible to describe Brahman as what ‘It’ is not but not as to what ‘It’ is.

"I am both bliss and non-bliss. I am knowledge and non-knowledge. I am Brahma and non-Brahma (the non-manifest state called A-Brahma). I am the five primordial principles and non-principles. I am the whole perceived Universe."

Brahman is full of all perfections. And to say that Brahman has some purpose in creating the world will mean that it wants to attain through the process of creation something which it has not. And that is impossible. Hence, there can be no purpose of Brahman in creating the world. The world is a mere spontaneous creation of Brahman. It is a Lila, or sport, of Brahman. It is created out of Bliss, by Bliss and for Bliss. Lila indicates a spontaneous sportive activity of Brahman as distinguished from a self-conscious volitional effort. The concept of Lila signifies freedom as distinguished from necessity.

The relation of Purusa to Prakrti—the unfolding force of nature—becomes here a relation of male to female. This is expressed in the Siva temple in the core image of the sivalinga, an expression of male (linga) and female (yoni) union. The basic cosmogonic motif of an unfolding or flowering cosmos is expressed here specifically in the relation of male to female, as well as in terms of consciousness and intentionality (in the concept of lila as the divine play of male and female.

isolation- can be attained only by turning away from the distracting allure of the world and worshiping with single-pointed attention the formless Brahman-Atman; to the Tantric, however—as to the normal child of the world—this notion seems pathological, the wrong-headed effect of a certain malady of intellect.

"I like eating sugar," said, "but I have no desire to become sugar."

Let those who suffer from the toils of samsara seek release: the perfect devotee does not suffer; for he can both visualize and experience life and the universe as the revelation of that Supreme Divine Force (shakti) with which he is in love, the all-comprehensive Divine Being in its cosmic aspect of playful, aimless display (lila)—which precipitates pain as well as joy, but in its bliss transcends them both.

Ever since ‘ Lila’ begins it is exponentiality manifesting and shifting towards higher and higher realms. Our world is created by self-sacrifice of God—"sacrifice" in the original sense of "making sacred"—whereby God becomes the world which, in the end, becomes God again. This creative activity of the Divine is called lila, the play of God, and the world is seen as the stage of the divine play. It can never comprehend in any physical or vital or spiritual realms.

The more we try to learn lila, the more we suffer in maya, and all these occur due to Ignorance alone.

Meditation, concentration, self-enquiry, study, reflection, contemplation develop the mind and intellect, devotion, kirtan, praises, prayers develop the heart and hatha yoga asanas, pranayama, body exercises like walking, jogging, sports train the body and prana.. There are also special asanas and pranayama for transformation of sexual energy. The irony is it should

Happen randomly without any expectations or perceptions, it emanates only when our seeking ends. Since the thing we were seeking was lies within yourself. Rather than seeking into the inside, we opt for the external pleasures and mayas; Hence we Suffer.

We are living in a matrix which is a perpetual cycle of Lila, created by ourselves due to the influence of Maya. “Our entire reality is created via a spell of unmonitored thoughts”, chained after chained creating a never ending loop of Samsara & Sushupti. Even though a slightest shift

Awareness could bring a radical shift. We can never understand Maya, never conquer, never master since we ourselves are the products of ‘Maya”, when i say ‘I’, which is governed and nurtured by my thoughts which is a result of ‘Maya’. There’s no point in playing a game, if you don’t play it as a game.Rather than considering life as Primordial, just go with the flow, play like a game, in which we have to play every moment, This dynamic play is called ‘Karma’, it can be of any form or kind,

Myth of lila has a strong magical flavour or a mystical touch. Brahman is the great magician who transforms himself into the world and then performs this feat with his "magic creative power", which is the original form of maya.. From the might, or power, of the divine actor and magician, it came to signify the psychological state of anybody under the spell of the magic play. As long as we confuse the myriad forms of the divine lila with reality, without perceiving the unity of Brahman underlying all these forms, we are under the spell of maya !

All forms are relative, fluid and ever-changing maya, The world of maya changes continuously, because the divine lila is a rhythmic, dynamic play. The dynamic force of the play is karma, Karma means "action". It is the active principle of the play, the total universe in action, where everything is dynamically connected with everything else. In the words of the Gita Karma is the force of creation, wherefrom all things have their life. However never consider karma as a boon,

Rather embrace it; since it is the only truth that shines always. Karma facilitates your destiny and sufferings, but also there can’t be polarity in b/w these. There is no such thing as Good or Bad, same as the sides of the coin, it’s the nature of Maya, it implies the duality of nature.Only

Because bad exists, good exists vice versa..which is fundamentally representing the causality of nature and time . All the separations and differences are due to the result of Maya, which is a never ending cycle. The only way to purge out is to realise the Maya, accept it and seek the truth..So the lila becomes anadha lila.

Desirelessness, dispassion and deep meditation are necessary in order to be able to transform sexual energy completely.But the most important of all is to eliminate the desire for sexual pleasure and all kinds of pleasures. Is the desire that makes the sexual energy flow downwards and outwards. Sexual thoughts and sexual emotional impulses activate immediately the sexual energy and due to the memory of orgasmic experience impel the energy to flow outwards. Thus as long as passion and lust exist in our mind it is impossible to avoid loss of sexual energy and especially semen for men. Desirelessness, dispassion and deep meditation are necessary in order to be able to transform the sexual energy completely.

“Without chastity and sublimation of sexual energy Self-realization is impossible”

Sexual energy nourishes the physical body, the heart and the intellect. Only that man who uses the physical body, the heart and the intellect can have perfect Brahmacharya (chastity, preserve and transform the sexual energy to ojas y tejas). Until to dissolve the desire for sexual pleasure from our chitta and succeed in deep meditation, in order to avoid loss of sexual energy is necessary to practice and develop all aspects of our personality; viz. body, prana, heart, mind and intellect.

Law of Seker

When the emotions of Man manifest in response to the Word of God, they have the power to influence the course of any and all events in the world.

Reasoning:

If we have access to God’s spiritual power through the cultivation of the ability to be at peace in situations of difficulties, why give in to anger, fear, lust, etc.? Why shouldn’t we be at peace in the face of difficulties?

“The light of the body is the eye: if therefore thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be full of light.”

– I understand that God has saved us by sharing Its spiritual power with us. I know I will successfully develop these powers because I have no problem keeping my heart still and dying to the things of the world for the kingdom of heaven.
– I am the likeness of God. I’ve got the power of God within me. I am the power of God, not in amount but in kind, thus I am relaxed in the face of the greatest challenges.
– I will succeed in life because I have surrendered to the Divine Plan.
Omnipotence/The power of creation

The Kamitic spiritual science holds that creation is brought about by Word, invocation, or vibration. Thus Sphere also represents words of power, or mantra..The original Godly vibration which created the (our) world was said to be aung. That initial Godly word of vibration was emitted from that aspect of the Creator. The Kamitic scripture has God saying: “I brought into my mouth my own name, that is to say, a word of power, and I, even I, came into being in the form of things which came into being, and I came in the forms of the Creator.”

divine faculty that is in charge of the life-force (Ra), which is the formative base of all things in the world. Although the source of life is infinite, each entity is allowed to share in its infinity through a series of cycles of births. Each entity is thus allotted a finite portion of this life-force at a time, for its adventure in the world. This recycling principle governs the cycles of birth, growth, decay, death, rebirth and so on. The life-force behaves in this manner in conformity with the divine intention of guiding man to the realization of his divinity.

The subjection of the existence of all things to cyclical revolutions, which is governed by the “deity”, divides their life term into two fundamental phases. Birth (rebirth)/growth, and decay/death (rebirth into the plane of origin!).

Thus we achieve an infinitude of experiences through an infinite chain of finite existences.

No two things can occupy the same place at the same time.

Divine law, therefore, guarantees all things their day in the sun. Our coming into being, and the unfolding of all events in our life are controlled by the spiritual forces for the sake of maintaining order in the world. Destiny, therefore, is nothing more nor less than the expression of the structure, the plan that governs the unfolding of people’s lives in order to guarantee them success. It is amazing to see how people are aware of the confusion and disorder that follow from the lack of planning and structure yet fail to realize that the same would happen in nature and in the world, if the Supreme Being had not laid a plan to guide the lives of men and nations. As above, So below!

When we die or transcend the way of life in which earthly pleasure and personal interests are the motivating factors of our actions and undertakings, in either case, we have died to the earth-physically or spiritually. The doctrines of Seeker, represent then, the teachings that kill. When we keep in mind that the spirit is essentially unconditioned, it will be realized that our spirit is ever receptive to be reprogrammed to express joy and pleasure in response to any situation or stimulus. We can therefore transcend a way of life in which our will is led by what gives us pleasure, and change over to a way in which pleasure follows our will to live new truths.

Kali, the Great Mother who wears the necklace of 50 skulls. As mistress of the words of power, and mother of all living things, is depicted as traveling in the boat of the star Sirius, which is propelled by 50 oarsmen. These sound units are distributed throughout the 14 chakras making up man’s subtle body.
