Transforming Desire Into Enlightenment.

Over the centuries, Tantra has been passed from one generation to the other in form of an empirical transmission. It has always been the master’s prerogative to determine the mode and technique of meditation that will help his disciple arouse his awareness, love, inner sensitivity, and fluidity. As a matter of fact, the quality and value of tantra transmission is largely dependent on the level of experience of the tantra teacher. The reason for this is simple; people can only give what they have. The depth and breadth of a master’s experience in tantra traditions and practice will determine how well the disciple will be able to learn and imbibe the teachings. There are quite a number of Tantra traditions that have been transmitted and these are based on the level of skills of one or more tantra masters of the particular lineage. In this article, we will look at the seven most famous traditions of tantra that have been passed down through the lineage.

Tantra Yoga
This tradition is Spartan and masculine oriented. Experts in this tantra tradition utilize yogic disciplines. In some cases, they get involved in a sexual union but are advised not to start a relationship or fall in love. In this tradition, sexual union is utilized like a rocket tool to ascend a keen spiritual state.

Kashmiri Tantra
This tradition honors Shakti and Shiva. It provides an exceptional combination of the feminine pathway of devotion and love with the masculine path of awareness and witness. In this tradition, love is seen as a spiritual path that should be esteemed. There are various methods that are utilized which include the use of sexuality for inner awakening. There are some others that focus on another area of human experiences like mental cognition, subtle spiritual condition, and emotions.

Aghori Tantra
This explores keen spiritual state of mind through special powers of Yogic Siddhis. It offers the inevitability of physical limitations such as death. Many of the practices of this tradition are extreme, like ritual and meditation carried out in burning ghats, in places where dead people are cremated.


The Baul Mystics
Originating from Bengal, the Baul mystic is a blend of Tantra, elements of Sufi Tradition, and Bhakti, brought together to provide a celebrative path of singing and dancing, which throbs with joy and live wisdom.

Neo-Tantra
Propagated by Osho, it is a term that illustrates Osho’s vision of a world founded on tantra approach to love, spirituality, and life. There are many different experiments that are being conducted under the Neo-Tantra tradition that are different from the vision of Osho.

Taoist or Chinese Tantra
This tradition focuses on the facets of immortality, longevity, and health through breathing techniques, massage, qigong, and sexual union. Experts in such tantra traditions will usually recommend a method of lovemaking and sexual positions to cure health issues.

Mahayana and Vajrayana
One sometimes hears of three "yanas" (vehicles) of Buddhism -- Hinayana ("small vehicle"), Mahayana ("great vehicle"), and Vajrayana ("diamond vehicle") -- with tantra being the distinguishing feature of Vajrayana. Sorting the many schools and sects of Buddhism into these three categories is not helpful to understanding Buddhism, however.

The Vajrayana sects are founded solidly on Mahayana philosophies and doctrines; tantra is a method by which the teachings are actualized. Vajrayana is best understood as an extension of Mahayana.

Further, although Buddhist tantra is most often associated with the Vajrayana sects of Tibetan Buddhism, it is by no means limited to Tibetan Buddhism. To a greater or lesser degree, elements of tantra can be found in many Mahayana schools, especially in Japan.

Japanese Zen, Pure Land, Tendai and Nichiren Buddhism, for example, all have strong veins of tantra running through them. Japanese Shingon Buddhism is thoroughly tantric.

Origins of Buddhist Tantra
As with many other aspects of Buddhism, myth, and history don't always find their way to the same source.

Vajrayana Buddhists say tantric practices were expounded by the historical Buddha. A king approached the Buddha and explained that his responsibilities did not allow him to abandon his people and become a monk. Yet, in his privileged position, he was surrounded by temptations and pleasures. How could he realize enlightenment? The Buddha responded by teaching the king tantric practices that would transform pleasures into transcendent realization.

Historians speculate that tantra was developed by Mahayana teachers in India very early in the first millennia CE. It is possible that this was a way to reach those who weren't responding to teachings from the sutras.

Wherever it came from, by the 7th century CE tantric Buddhism was fully systemized in northern India. This was significant to the development of Tibetan Buddhism. The first Buddhist teachers in Tibet, beginning in the 8th century with the arrival of Padmasambhava, were tantric teachers from northern India.

By contrast, Buddhism reached China about the year 1. Mahayana Buddhist sects that emerged in China, such as Pure Land and Zen, also incorporate tantric practices, but these are not nearly as elaborate as in Tibetan tantra.

Sutra Versus Tantra
Vajrayana teachers compare what they call the gradual, causal, or sutra path of Buddhism to the speedier tantra path.

By "sutra" path, they mean following the Precepts, developing meditative concentration, and studying sutras to develop seeds, or causes, of enlightenment. In this way, enlightenment will be realized in the future.

Tantra, on the other hand, is a means to bring this future result into the present moment by realizing oneself as an enlightened being.

The Pleasure Principle
We've already defined Buddhist tantra as "a means to enlightenment through identity with tantric deities." This is a definition that works for most tantric practices in Mahayana and Vajrayana.

Vajrayana Buddhism also defines tantra as a means to channel the energy of desire and transform the experience of pleasure into a realization of enlightenment.

According to the late Lama Thubten Yeshe,

"The same desirous energy that ordinarily propels us from one unsatisfactory situation is transmuted, through the alchemy of tantra, into a transcendental experience of bliss and wisdom. The practioner focuses the penetrating brilliance of this blissful wisdom so that it cuts like a laser beam through all false projections of this and that and pierces the very heart of reality." ("Introduction to Tantra: A Vision of Totality" [1987], p. 37)

Behind Closed Doors
In Vajrayana Buddhism, the practitioner is initiated into incremental levels of esoteric teachings under the guidance of a guru. Upper-level rituals and teachings are not made public. This esotericism, combined with the sexual nature of much Vajrayana art, has led to much winking and nudging about upper-level tantra.

Vajrayana teachers say most of the practices of Buddhist tantra are not sexual and that it mostly involves visualizations. Many tantric masters are celibate. It's likely nothing goes on in upper-level tantra that couldn't be shown to schoolchildren.

It is very likely that there is a good reason for the secretiveness. In this absence of guidance from an authentic teacher, it is possible that the teachings could easily be misunderstood or misused.



Tantra is in its renaissance period. The vision is to nurture life in its entirety while embracing human tendency and nature as the superlative interpretation of universal force.
