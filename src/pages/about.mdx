I live in Banglore, IN with my partner and jenny.
Hailing from Kerala, South IN. I travel too often to Dubai, Rishikesh, and Nainital.

I Code, Trade, Build, Write, Hike and Travel.

My tech career was always Crypto oriented. I am using Bitcoin since 2015. I developed some of the early Bitcoin portable nodes using Raspberry pi.  I love contributing to Open Source projects. I never got a chance to work in the Corp lifestyle, even though I partnered with a few for DevOps.

My area of interest varies in different subjects including but not limited to Psycheledics, Effective-Altruism,  Post-humanism, Nihilism, Techno-Spiritual, Esoteric & Occult traditions, Mountains, Galaxies, Advaita, Vedantas & Upanishads, Energy, Zen Buddhism, and more. 

I have been Practicing Sanatan Dharma for a few years, methodologies not just limited to Meditation, Yoga, Tantric, Mantra Chanting, Psychdelic, Trekking, Pilgrimage, and learning Vedas.  I am not a fan of strict one-way, I occasionally swap and do these methods accordingly.
For me, the ultimate move is to be in a thoughtless state as long as I can, Irrespective of the ways. 

We occasionally spend a few months in Uttarakhand, mostly trekking or pilgrimage. When I am away from my desk, You can spot me 
at the banks of the river Ganges in Rishikesh or Kainchi Dam in Nainital. Keeping a secret life for years, ofc I'm an Introvert
living with an Extrovert. I hardly interact with people ( virtually/physically) and I am a vivid hippie who welcomes all experiences induced by drugs. 

I do future trading sometimes (crypto), however, most of the time end up in heavy loss. I trade Crypto, Ens, and NFTs as of now.  I advocate and build crypto products and projects too.

My life from my experience is full of magic and mystery, with the least suffering and craving I am enjoying my life every day. I had put a tremendous amount of energy is researching the secrets of life and the nature of reality, and my endurance is ever-increasing;

Apart from Metaverse, I love learning and making music. I'm more fascinated towards Violine, Kalimba, Handpan and Acoustic Guitar.

Here in this blog, I shower my ideas, thoughts, and essence of reality and truth. Every experience can be different for everyone and ultimately depends upon the perspective of the user, even though only one  Truth exists.

I curate informations from multiple sources sometimes even from the least expected place, However I make sure none of the
facts violate any ethics and morality. Most of the wisdom shared across the Blog is based on my own real life experiences, supporting facts
and infomration are added from various scripture and literature.
